KVM Unit Tests Maintainers
==========================

The intention of this file is not to establish who owns what portions of the
code base, but to provide a set of names that developers can consult when they
have a question about a particular subset and also to provide a set of names
to be CC'd when submitting a patch to obtain appropriate review.

In general, if you have a question about inclusion of a patch, you
should consult the KVM mailing list <kvm@vger.kernel.org> and not any
specific individual privately.

Descriptions of section entries:

	M: Mail patches to: FullName <address@domain>
        CC: Suggested CC's for review, does not guarantee review!
	L: Mailing list that is relevant to this area
	T: SCM tree type and location.  Type is one of: git, hg, quilt, stgit.
	F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	drivers/net/	all files in and below drivers/net
	   F:	drivers/net/*	all files in drivers/net, but not below
	   F:	*/net/*		all files in "any top level directory"/net
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
